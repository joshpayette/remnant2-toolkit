    description: `Crafted from an enigmatic substance that resembles hardened bone in appearance. These gloves are a powerful tool in the hands of those who would wield the void, drawing energy from the emptiness between worlds to unleash devastating attacks. But with great power comes great cost, and those who dare to wear these gloves must be prepared to pay the price.`,

    description: `Long gloves fit like a vice around your arms, the pressure quickening your pulse and increasing your awareness. Your hands are well protected with the exception of a few exposed fingertips, intentionally left unguarded in case a given ritual requires quick access to fresh blood.`,
