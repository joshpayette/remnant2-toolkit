        Builds can be shared by clicking the Share Build button on the Builder,
        which will automatically copy the build URL to your clipboard.
        <br /> <br />
        If you are not signed into the Toolkit, the URL can get quite long. In
        this situation, it is suggested to click the Generate Image button. This
        will open a dialog with an image that you can download or copy/paste to
        share the build. This is often better than the long URL and preferred by
        the community.

        Items can be marked optional if they aren't required in order for the

        Items can be toggled on/off by clicking the{' '}
        <OptionalOffIcon className="h-4 w-4 text-yellow-500" /> icon at the top
        left of each item button when creating or editing a build.

        Clicking the Armor Calculator button will open a dialog that will
        suggest items to reach a specified weight class. It will account for any
        items you currently have equipped in the builder, so it's the perfect
        tool for trying to find the best possible option to reach a specific
        weight class.

        Clicking the Item Suggestions button will open a dialog that will allow
        you to view all items that match a specified item token. The dialog will
        allow you to also add the item to the builder if you don't already have
        it.

        If you've collected all or most of the items in the game and are looking
        for a challenge, you can click the Random Build button on the builder to
        generate a random build.
