## General tips

- Picking Apocalypse as your starting difficulty will give you extra gold awhen you first start. You can then reroll your campaign to veteran at the stone.
- If you want additional easy gold at the start, roll for **Yaesha - Forgotten Grove** or **Yaesha - Red Throne** for 1-3 chests if you want starting money. You can pick up the chests and then reroll campaign again.
- You should always have a concoction active, ideally [Mudtooth's Tonic](https://remnant.wiki/Mudtooth%27s_Tonic).
- Items are account-wide, so check with Reggie, Cass, and Brabus to get specific items you might want to use.
- Once you have 1500x Scrap and 5 Lumenite, you can get your second archetype.
- Max out Vigor as quickly as you can. If you get Meidra in Yaesha, grab Barkskin and level that up first.
- Only go for progression dungeons and not side dungeons.
- Sell boss rewards to give yourself some additional scrap.
- You can farm the Preacher in **Losomn - Forlorn Coast** to level 3 mutators up to level 10. These do not count towards your power level.
- Gravity kills! Be sure to check down below before dropping off ledges or jumping down!
- Be sure to keep your game **offline**. Randoms can teamkill you and it will count as a hardcore death.
- If you are unsure about certain boss fights, keeping a softcore character with the same skills and gear is a good idea to help you practice the fight.
- Find yourself autopiloting or zoning out? Take a break! Autopilot is a good way to get yourself killed.
- Don't be afraid to run from fights if you need to. You can always come back later when you're stronger.

## Understanding power levels

### What are power levels?

Powerlevels are used in two ways in Remnant 2:

- Your character has a power level, which is based on the power level of your 2 highest archetypes, and an average of your highest weapon level for each weapon slot.

  _You can check your character's power level by looking on the left side of the character screen._

- The zone you are in has a power level. This level is based upon the power level of your character and/or the minimum power level for the zone. You can check the zone power level by looking at the number on the minimap.

### Why are they important for hardcore?

Power levels are important for hardcore because it will help you to keep the difficulty manageable as you complete your run. This will allow you to reach Annihilation by power level 14 and lock the boss level there, meaning you could outlevel the fight to better ensure a chance of success.

### How do I manage power levels?

Generally speaking, you don't need to worry too much about your archetype power levels, as they level quite slowly. You will want to be sure when levelling your weapons to try and keep your power level at the same power level of the zone you're in. Be sure to keep checking your power level as you level your weapons.

## Picking an archetype

There are many viable archetypes for completing your hardcore veteran run. Any archetypes unlocked on your account will be available either as your starting class, or sold by Wallace and the other respective vendors in town.

### Archon

Archon is a good choice because you start with the Enigma pistol, which helps a ton with clearing hordes of trash mobs. The mod generation granted by the class can also help you make use of the early mods you pick up at the start of your run. Additionally, the shock damage from the pistol is additionally helpful in N'Erud, where the mobs are weaker to Shock.

### Challenger

Challenger is a good choice as it allows you to wear heavier armor while still keeping your weight class lower thanks to the Strong Back trait. Additionally, having Challenger as the primary archetype will allow you to cheat death once every 10 minutes.

### Engineer

Engineer has a turret and the Fortify trait for some extra tankiness. The turret scales with your level, and can put out good damage while you might be more focused on survival.

### Handler

Handler is an excellent choice for your hardcore run. When equipped as the primary archetype, your dog will revive you when you die. This can definitely be a lifesaver, as the cooldown is much shorter than the cheat death provider by the Challenger archetype.

### Medic

Medic can be a strong choice for the self-healing potential for you (and your allies if you are playing with a group).

### Ritualist

Ritualist is the newest archetype at time of writing, and it offers a strong choice for a starting archetype. You start with the Sparkfire Shotgun, which is strong in Yaesha as almost everything there is weak to Fire. The Miasma ability, gained at Ritualist level 5, is great for clearing mobs and for gaining experience rapidly. Additionally, Ritualist works very well with the Energized Neck Coil, which is attainable as soon as you clear your first world and enter the Labyrinth. Lastly, Ritualist will benefit from the Ahanae Ring, which you can purchase from Reggie in town as soon as you clear your first world in hardcore.

## Recommended archetypes

This guide recommends starting with Engineer, and then picking up Handler as your second archetype. Once you have the Handler, swap it to your primary archetype and put Engineer on your secondary.

## Acquiring your second archetype

You can pick up a second archetype as soon as you have 1500x Scrap and 5 Lumenite. You can then purchase the item from either Wallace or one of the in town vendors. It is recommended that you do this as soon as you have the materials for it.

## First things to do in town

When you first load into town, it is suggested that you:

- Sell all items that you start with to get scrap to get other more important starting items.
- Craft the Healing Shot mod to help supplement your heals.
- If you are able, you should also craft Hot Shot to further increase your damage output.
- If you have item unlocks from other characters, pick up helpful items from Reggie, such as [Black Cat Band](https://remnant.wiki/Black_Cat_Band).
- You can get the [MP60-R](https://remnant.wiki/MP60-R) pistol for free in town if you don't like your starting pistol.

## Campaign starting zone

The recommendation is to start your campaign in **Yaesha - Red Palace**. This is because you get the [Thaen Seed](https://remnant.wiki/Thaen_Seed) from the Widow's Court, which is incredibly helpful for survival as you progress through the campaign. Additionally, you can get the [Seal of the Empress](https://remnant.wiki/Seal_of_the_Empress) Ring for more survivability by showing deference in all dialogs with the Empress.

### Why not Yaesha - Forgotten Grove?

The Forgotten Grove is a commonly recommended starting zone, as you can skip a world boss (Ravager) by killing the Doe. However, the mid-dungeon boss fights are considered more difficult than if you start Red Palace. Additionally, losing access to Thaen Fruit and Seal of the Empress make the Forgotten Grove a less useful starting zone.

### Red Palace tips

- Be sure you are polite to the Empress in all dialogs so that you can earn the [Seal of the Empress](https://remnant.wiki/Seal_of_the_Empress) ring.
- When you reach The Widow's Court, be sure to grab the [Ornate Lockbox](https://remnant.wiki/Ornate_Lockbox) and [Ornate Key](https://remnant.wiki/Ornate_Key) so that you can get the [Thaen Seed](https://remnant.wiki/Thaen_Seed) from the Empress. Planting this fruit in town will give you a cheat death fruit.

## When you first reach Labyrinth

Once you clear the first world on hardcore, you have unlocked the [Ahanae Crystal](https://remnant.wiki/Ahanae_Crystal) ring. You can purchase it from Reggie, and should consider doing so right away.

Additionally, you can immediately get the [Energized Neck Coil](https://remnant.wiki/Energized_Neck_Coil) that can be quite helpful depending on your archetypes.

## Once you have the Biome Portal Key in Labyrinth

Once you have the [Biome Portal Key](https://remnant.wiki/Biome_Portal_Key), it is recommended that you do the following:

- Grab the [Leto Mark II armor set](https://remnant.wiki/Leto_Mark_II_Armor).
- Open the portals and touch the waypoint in each of the two worlds you can open up. This will lock the powerlevels for those zones ahead of time.

## Things to look out for as you progress

- If you happen to roll both Morrow's Parrish in Losomn and Seeker's Rest in N'Erud, you can get the [Tranquil Heart](https://remnant.wiki/Tranquil_Heart) relic to greatly increase your survival.
