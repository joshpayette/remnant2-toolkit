### Fixed

- Updated Docker config to support hot module refresh in local development environment.

## 2024-03-15

- Updated the images for Bloat King boss and Little Gorge aberration. (ConRaven)
- Removed DESCRIPTION_TAGS from autocomplete search boxes as it is no longer necessary.

### Changed

- Removed navigation links to Collection Builds.
- Added a notice to the top of the /builder route informing users that the features are limited. This page is a landing page for builds exported from other tools, but due to limitations in the handling of URL state rather than a database, it does not have all the build features. This was confusing for users who ended up on this page.
- Changed the layout of the item information in the dialog and item cards to be more consistent and easier to read.

- Added more aberration images (ConRaven is a god)
- Added Blightspawn aberration to tracker

### Changed

- Profile link in the nav bar will now go to your public profile.
- Updated create build logic to remove the redirect. Essentially the original URL version of the builder exists at `/builder`, and the newer database integrated version is `/builder/create`. I had originally had a redirect on `/builder/create` to redirect if the user is not signed in. However, this was causing the page to not be indexed properly by crawlers. Now, an overlay explaining to either sign in or use the URL builder will show if the user is unauthenticated. Additionally, the Create Build link in the Navbar will link to the correct version based on whether the user is authenticated.

- Fixed a bug where the tooltips would exceed the container element and cause a scrollbar in the Stats portion of the builder.

## 2024-02-24

### Changed
